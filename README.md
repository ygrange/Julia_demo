# Julia_demo
Repo hosting the example notebook that came with my software lunch.

To run the notebook (I assume you have jupyter or ipython installed):
1. go to http://www.julialang.org and download Julia
2. run Julia and type 
   pkg.add("IJulia")
3. When IJulia is installed, run ipython or jupyter with the notebook option and run the notebook.
